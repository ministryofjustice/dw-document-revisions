**DW Document Revisions is three things:**

1. A **document management system** (DMS), to track, store, and organize files of any format
2. A **collaboration tool** to empower teams to collaboratively draft, edit, and refine documents
3. A **file hosting solution** to publish and securely deliver files to a team, to clients, or to the public
